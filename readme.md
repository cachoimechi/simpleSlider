#Simple Slider

##A minimal jQuery slider for web content

This project serves as a bare bones slider with limited functionality, best used as a quick and dirty solution, or for minimalist wireframe demos.

###Usage

The slider.js file requires a few quick variables to be setup:

```javascript

//Setup Variables

var containerWidth = 600,	//width of container element
	slideSpeed = 'fast';	//speed of transition between slides

```
