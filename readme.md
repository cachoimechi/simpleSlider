#Simple Slider

##A minimal jQuery slider for web content

This project serves as a bare bones slider with limited functionality, best used as a quick and dirty solution, or for minimalist wireframe demos.

###Usage

As this is a jQuery slider, you will first need to include the jQuery library. You can access to latest version [here](http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js).

The slider.js file requires a few quick variables to be setup:

```javascript

//Setup Variables

var containerWidth = 600,	//width of container element
	slideSpeed = 'fast';	//speed of transition between slides
```

After you setup the variables to your needs, it is best to minify the script for production.
